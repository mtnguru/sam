TODO:
  
- support a filter to emit a list of glossary_old terms used in a post (which might
  be formatted as a sidebox in an article).

- make another filter which discovers candidate glossary_old terms
  (perhaps any sequence of 3 or more capital letters) and save those
  in a table where the admin "promote" them to glossary_old term status and
  give them definitions if they are in fact worthy of glossary_old status.
